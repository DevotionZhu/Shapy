#DONE
- add buffer to point and multipoint as well

#TO ADD
- complete the distance methods for all types
- give option of dissolving or not when doing buffer, thus multigeoms should use their childs' buffer method and then decide whether to do union or return buffers as potentially overlapping geoms. 
- add final comparison methods like contains, within, etc. 

#TO FIX
- buffer does not work for multilinestring, should buffer each line separately and then maybe union them.
- buffer for normal lines is weird, should use own function from pydraw geomhelper.
- not major, but decide whether to return both closestpoints even when one or both are single points. Also decide whether to return any closestpoints if a shape is overlapping or right next to (0 distance), since for polygons or lines in a polygon it doesn't make sense to say that a single point is closest bc they all have 0 distance, but then again for multipart geoms it might be useful to know which geom had 0 distance, but then again if all parts are inside which one to choose?
